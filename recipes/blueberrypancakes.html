        <h2><u>Recipe</u></h2>
          <p>My parents made blueberry pancakes for my brother and me every weekend when I was a kid. My mom grew a giant patch of blueberries in her garden and she would freeze so many of the berries that we could use them for pancakes year-round. They were so proud of how many berries they used; they used <em>a lot</em> of berries. When we had pancakes at restaurants they were outraged that each pancake had so few berries in it. <em>Only eight blueberries in one pancake?! This is a disgrace!</em> In this recipe, I invite you to disregard my parents' judgement and use as many or as few blueberries as your heart desires.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1 cup Bob's Red Mill gluten-free pancake mix</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp melted salted butter</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>fresh or frozen blueberries</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Heat a lightly greased griddle or pan over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Mix all ingredients together in a bowl until just combined. Do not over-mix.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/4 cup batter onto the hot pan.</li>
            <li>Quickly pour lots of (or a little) blueberries onto the batter and use a butterknife to spread the batter to cover the blueberries. This is so the berries don't stick to the pan after you flip the pancake.</li>
            <li>Cook until the batter bubbles, flip and let cook until done, about 2-3 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately. Makes 8 pancakes.</li>
        </ol>
