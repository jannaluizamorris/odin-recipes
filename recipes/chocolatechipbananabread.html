  <h2><u>Recipe</u></h2>
    <p>This is one of my mom's favorite foods to bake and share with her kids. She and I have been gluten-free for almost ten years so we've been using gluten-free flour instead of white flour. I can honestly attest that I cannot taste the difference between the two different flours in this recipe. The bread is just as moist and light with gluten-free flour as it is with white flour. The addition of chocolate chips transforms banana bread from <em>just ok</em> to <em>oops I seem to have eaten the entire loaf in an hour.</em> Try it; I promise your taste buds will be so happy with you.</p>
