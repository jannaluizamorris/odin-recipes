    <h2><u>Recipe</u></h2>
      <p>When I was in high school, all the cool kids in my class were drinking coffee. I thought coffee was disgusting, plus the caffeine made me feel sick. Then I started going to coffee shops and discovered the decaf mocha latte. I thought it was genius; I get to drink something chocolate-y, don't have to taste the coffee, and I get to tell my friends that I drink coffee. When my mom learned that I was going to coffee shops, she was determined to help me save money. My mom was very frugal, and refused to pay 3 whole dollars for something she could recreate at home. I think you can already see where this recipe is going.</p>
