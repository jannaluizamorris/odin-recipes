      <h2><u>Recipe</u></h2>
        <p>This recipe is a childhood favorite. When the rhubarb cake is baking I can almost smell it in the kitchen of my childhood home. My favorite part is the cinnamon sugar topping. When the sugar melts in the oven, a crust forms that is somehow both crispy and melt-in-your-mouth buttery. If you bring this to a gathering, make sure to bring copies of the recipe because people will surely ask for it.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 1/2 cups brown sugar</li>
          <li>1/2 cup salted butter, softened, not melted</li>
          <li>2 eggs</li>
          <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
          <li>1 cup buttermilk, or 1 cup milk + 1 Tbsp white vinegar</li>
          <li>2 cups flour or Bob's Red Mill 1:1 gluten-free flour</li>
          <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
          <li>2 cups chopped rhubarb, add up to 2 extra cups for a more tart dessert</li>
          <li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
          <li>1 1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Cream brown sugar, butter, and eggs.</li>
          <li>In a separate bowl, mix baking soda and buttermilk together.</li>
          <li>In another separate bowl, mix flour and salt together.</li>
          <li>Alternate adding buttermilk mixture and flour mixture to creamed ingredients and mix gently.</li>
          <li>Fold in chopped rhubarb, then pour mixture into an ungreased 9x13 pan.</li>
          <li>Mix sugar and cinnamon together and evenly sprinkle on top of cake.</li>
          <li>Bake uncovered at 350 degrees for 40 minutes. Test doneness by inserting a toothpick; a dry toothpick means the cake is done.</li>
          <li>If the crust tastes too sweet or too spicy to you, experiment with changing the ratio of sugar to cinnamon next time you make the cake, which will probably be tomorrow.</li>
